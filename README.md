# üå©Ô∏è Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Management

Hey there, cloud enthusiasts! Welcome to multi-cloud infrastructure management project. Set up a robust infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud using Terraform, because why settle for just one cloud when you can have three? üòé

## üéØ What's the goal?

- Set up infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
- Create a unified dashboard for cross-cloud monitoring
- Implement cost-optimization and failover strategies


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools of the Trade

- Terraform (our infrastructure-as-code superhero)
- Prometheus (for gathering all those juicy metrics)
- Grafana (to make our dashboards look pretty)
- AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud (our cloud playground)

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project demonstrates how to set up a robust, multi-cloud infrastructure with unified monitoring and cost optimization strategies. It's designed to be easily expandable and customizable for different use cases.

To implement the failover strategy, we're relying on the load balancers in each cloud provider to route traffic to healthy instances. If an instance or even an entire region in one cloud provider fails, traffic can be redirected to instances in other clouds.

For further improvements, you could consider:

1. Implementing a global load balancer (like AWS Global Accelerator or Google Cloud Load Balancing) to route traffic between cloud providers
2. Setting up data replication between clouds for stateful applications
3. Implementing more sophisticated monitoring and alerting based on cross-cloud metrics
4. Creating automated scripts for failover scenarios

## Important Notice

### **Azure Credentials Not Included**
To ensure security and avoid any unnecessary charges:
- **Azure credentials are not included in this repository.** 
- Please use your own Azure subscription and credentials to configure and deploy this project.

### Why This Is Important
Using someone else‚Äôs credentials or sharing your credentials publicly could lead to:
- **Overcharges**: Unintended usage in the Azure account may result in unexpected costs.
- **Security Risks**: Unauthorized access to your Azure resources.

## Getting Started

1. **Set Up Your Azure Account**  
   If you don‚Äôt already have one, create an Azure account at [https://azure.microsoft.com/](https://azure.microsoft.com/). New users may be eligible for free services or credits.

2. **Update the Credentials**  
   - Configure your Azure credentials in the code by setting the appropriate environment variables or using a credentials file.
   - Refer to the Azure documentation for more information: [Azure Authentication Methods](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

3. **Run the Project**  
   Follow the setup instructions in [INSTALL.md] or the steps outlined below:
   ```bash
   # Example command to set up environment variables
   export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
   export AZURE_TENANT_ID=<your-tenant-id>
   export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
